            <h3>Movie Marathon</h3>
            <p>A Film Marathon is a low‑threshold activity for youth and young adults. In a Film Marathon, we use what we have available — for example a mobile phone, a webcam, or any other equipment — since the focus is on mastering interpretation and storytelling, rather than the technical quality of the video itself. During the workshop, participants receive training in everything from script writing to acting and camera work, and they are supported by mentors throughout the entire marathon.</p>
            <p>The main task is to interpret a word or theme that is handed out on the first day, and over the course of the week the participants collaborate to create a short film based on their interpretation. We conclude the marathon with a collective screening, celebrating the achievement as a small film festival, where the participants also receive constructive feedback from mentors. The purpose is to create a sense of accomplishment and to strengthen collaboration.</p>
